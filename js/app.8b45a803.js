Work closely with relevant domain experts for your model (e.g., healthcare, retail, etc.) to identify what interpretability features are needed, and why. While rare, there are some cases/systems where with sufficient empirical evidence, fine-grain interpretability is not needed.\\n- Can you analyze your training/testing data? For example, if you are working with private data, you may not have access to investigate your input data.\\n- Can you change your training/testing data, for example, gather more training data for certain subsets (e.g., parts/slices of the feature space), or gather test data for categories of interest?\\n- Can you design a new model or are you constrained to an already-trained model?\\n- Are you providing too much transparency, potentially opening up vectors for abuse?\\n- What are your post-train interpretability options? Will you have access to the internals of the model (e.g., black box vs. white box)?\\n\\n2) Treat interpretability as a core part of the user experience\\n- Iterate with users in the development cycle to test and refine your assumptions about user needs and goals.\\n- Design the UX so that users build useful mental models of the AI system. If not given clear and compelling information, users may make up their own theories about how an AI system works, which can negatively affect how they try to use the system.\\n- Where possible, make it easy for users to do their own sensitivity analysis: empower them to test how different inputs affect the model output.\\n- Additional relevant UX resources: Designing for human needs, user control, teaching an AI, habituation, fairness, representation\\n\\n3) Design the model to be interpretable\\n- Use the smallest set of inputs necessary for your performance goals to make it clearer what factors are affecting the model.\\n- Use the simplest model that meets your performance goals.\\n- Learn causal relationships not correlations when possible (e.g., use height not age to predict if a kid is safe to ride a roller coaster).\\n- Craft the training objective to match your true goal (e.g., train for the acceptable probability of false alarms, not accuracy).\\n- Constrain your model to produce input-output relationships that reflect domain expert knowledge (e.g., a coffee shop should be more likely to be recommended if it’s closer to the user, if everything else about it is the same).\\n\\n4) Choose metrics to reflect the end-goal and the end-task\\n- The metrics you consider must address the particular benefits and risks of your specific context. For example, a fire alarm system would need to have high recall, even if that means the occasional false alarm.\\n\\n5) Understand the trained model: Many techniques are being developed to gain insights into the model (e.g., sensitivity to inputs).\\n- Analyze the model’s sensitivity to different inputs, for different subsets of examples.\\n\\n6) Communicate explanations to model users\\n- Provide explanations that are understandable and appropriate for the user (e.g., technical details may be appropriate for industry practitioners and academia, while general users may find UI prompts, user-friendly summary descriptions or visualizations more useful). Explanations should be informed by a careful consideration of philosophical, psychological, computer science (including HCI), legal and ethical considerations about what counts as a good explanation in different contexts.\\n- Identify if and where explanations may not be appropriate (e.g., where explanations could result in more confusion for general users, nefarious actors could take advantage of the explanation for system or user abuse, or explanations may reveal proprietary information).\\n- Consider alternatives if explanations are requested by a certain user base but cannot or should not be provided, or if it\'s not possible to provide a clear, sound explanation. You could instead provide accountability through other mechanisms such as auditing or allow users to contest decisions or to provide feedback to influence future decisions or experiences.\\n- Prioritize explanations that suggest clear actions a user can take to correct inaccurate predictions going forward.\\n- Don’t imply that explanations mean causation unless they do.\\n- Recognize human psychology and limitations (e.g., confirmation bias, cognitive fatigue)\\n- Explanations can come in many forms (e.g., text, graphs, statistics): when using visualization to provide insights, use best practices from HCI and visualization.\\n- Any aggregated summary may lose information and hide details (e.g., partial dependency plots).\\n- The ability to understand the parts of the ML system (especially inputs) and how all the parts work together (“completeness”) helps users to build clearer mental models of the system. These mental models match actual system performance more closely, providing for a more trustworthy experience and more accurate expectations for future learning.\\n- Be mindful of the limitations of your explanations (e.g., local explanations may not generalize broadly, and may provide conflicting explanations of two visually-similar examples).\\n\\"","fr":""},"choices":[{"value":"itemA4B948","text":{"default":"Yes, inputs are reviewed internally as part of a general technology review","fr":""}},{"value":"itemA3DDD3","text":{"default":"Yes, inputs are reviewed internally independent of a technology review and include at least one of the following activities:\\n- Analysis of the systems training/testing data\\n- Multiple tests with different training/testing data, for example, gather more training data for certain subsets (e.g., parts/slices of the feature space), or gather test data for categories of interest\\n- Testing of different models \\n- Testing for right degree of transparency to mitigate any potential abuse\\n- System is built so users can set their own degree of sensitivity\\n- The smallest set of inputs necessary were used to make it clear which factors are affeting the model \\n- The simplest model to meet the performance goal was used\\n- Model learns on casual relationships not correlations when and where possible \\n- Model is trained to match true goal \\n- Model has been constrained to produce input-output relationships that reflect domain expert knowledge\\n- Metrics used address the particular benefits and risks of your specific context \\n- The model\'s sensitivity has been trained for different subsets of examples","fr":""}},{"value":"itemAD6BCC","text":{"default":"Yes, inputs are reviewed by a trusted third-party independent of a technology review","fr":""}},{"value":"itemAFE602","text":{"default":"No third third-party review is completed","fr":""}}]},{"type":"comment","name":"QF214D0","title":{"default":"Feedback:","fr":""},"alttext":{"default":"If possible, support the feedback with specific recommendations / suggestions to improve the tool.

This is due to the fact that the training process has resulted in setting the network parameters to numerical values that are difficult to correlate with the results. In addition, sometimes small changes in some values of the data might result in dramatic changes in the interpretation, leading the system to confuse a school bus with an ostrich for example. This specific issue might be used to deceive the system. \\n\\nFor a system to be trustworthy, it is necessary to be able to understand why it had a given behaviour and why it has provided a given interpretation. It is also necessary to limit these adversarial situations. As of today, this is still an open challenge to AI systems based on neural networks.
